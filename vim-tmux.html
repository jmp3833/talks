		  <h1>What is Vim?</h1>
		  <p>
	  	      <pre><code>"Vim is an advanced text editor 
that seeks to provide the power of the de-facto
 Unix editor 'Vi', with a more complete feature set."
		      </code></pre>

		  <h1>Well, What's Vi?</h1>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Short for 'visual editor'</li>
		    <li>Available on most unix platforms by default</li>
		    <li>A standard that vim adheres to</li>
		  </ul>

		  <h2>What makes Vim special?</h2>
                  <p> Vim has been around since 1991, with Vi under it's original name beginning in 1979. There's a reason it's so popular.</p>
		  <p> Vim has no mouse support by default, similar to your Picos, Nanos, and Emacs(sss)<p>
		  <p> Vim is a <b> modal </b> text editor. 
		</section>
		
		<section>
		  <h2>Whatcha mean by 'modal'?</h2>
                  <p>Vim supports many modes, including Visual, Insert, and Standard</p>

		  <h3>So, how do I use this thiing without a mouse?</h3>
		  <p> Looks like we're back to the days before GUI...</p>
                  <p> As a developer, it's actually more efficient to keep your mitts on the keyboard at all times!</p>
		</section>
		
                <section>
		  <h1><b>THIS IS HUGE!</b></h1>
		</section>
		
		<section>
		  <h2>Benefits Of No Mouse & GUI</h2>
		  <ul>
		    <li>this thing basically runs on anything with an OS</li>
		    <li>can work on server distributions with no window manager</li>
		    <li>plays incredibly well with SSH and other remote protocols</li>
		  </ul>

		  <h3>Yeah, but what about the stuff I lose?</h1>
		  <ul>
                    <li>Painfully slow to scroll a cursor around vim without a mouse</li>
	            <li>Where did my fancy syntax highlighting go?</li>
		    <li>How am I going to get by without autocomplete?</li>
		    <li>What about my debugger?</li>
		  </ul>

		  <h2>Answer: Plugins</h2>
		  <p>Plugin support for Vim is awesome! There are countless tools you can use to improve the experience. take a look at http://vimawesome.com/ for some popular examples</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
		  <h2>How do plugins work?</h2>
		  <ul>
		    <li>plugins and configurations for vim are stored in a .vimrc file</li>
		    <li>the 'rc' in vimrc stands for "runcom" => "run commands"</li>
		    <li>specifies commands to be executed before vim starts</li>
                  </ul>

		<section>
		  <h3>Need a plugin that doesn't exist yet?</h3>
		  <ul>
		    <li>No problem!</li>
		    <li>Vimscript (a simple scripting language) is packaged with vim</li>
		    <li>Many other plugins written in all sorts of languages</li>
                  </ul>
		</section>
		
		<section>
		  <h3>Keeping plugins in check</h3>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Two popular plugin managers, Vundle and Pathogen</li>
		    <li>Personally use vundle, but many devs are happy with both</li>
		    <li>There are others out there, pick your favorite!</li>
                  </ul>

		  <h2>Using Vim well</h2>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Learn touch typing before learning Vim</li>
		    <li>Don't use the arrow keys!</li> 
		    <li>Get familiar with other modes besides 'insert'</li>
		    <li>Use man pages and :vimtutor first to learn basics</li>
		    <li>Personally reccomend 'Practical Vim' for more advanced maneuvers</li> 
                  </ul>
		</section>

		  <h2>Improving Vim workflow</h2>
		  <p>Try working on a complex project you would normally use an IDE for completely in Vim. This works better in some languages than others.</p>
		  <p>Need multiple windows for shells, logs, and your editor? Try <a href="https://tmux.github.io/">Tmux!</a>
		<section>
		
		</section>
		  <h2>So, What's Tmux?</h2>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Stands for "Terminal Multiplexer"</li>
		    <li>Use to a bunch of programs in a single terminal using windows and panes</li>
		    <li>Easily 'detach' from a Tmux session to pause your work and continue later</li>
		    <li>Similar project, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">GNU Screen</a> Provides a subset of Tmux features</li>
	          </ul>

		  <h2>Why the heck would I use this?</h2>
		  <ul>
		    <li>I have that new fangled Iterm2, I can already split my windows</li>
		    <li>I use that cool JetBrains IDE, I can already see my Terminal</li>
		    <li>I like using Sublime text on one side, and my terminal on the other</li> 
		    <li><b>These solutions work... but can you easily run them on a server or without a mouse?</b></li>

		  <h2>Configuring Tmux</h2>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Uses a .tmux_conf file, similar to your new friend, the .vimrc</li>
		    <li>Commands can be remapped for different key combinations, and to display additional info</li>
	          </ul>
