		  <h2>What makes Vim special?</h2>
                  <p> Vim has been around since 1991, with Vi under it's original name beginning in 1979. There's a reason it's so popular.</p>
		  <p> Vim has no mouse support by default, similar to your Picos, Nanos, and Emacs(sss)<p>
		  <p> Vim is a <b> modal </b> text editor.
